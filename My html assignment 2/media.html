        I'm Boladale Ibrahim Oluwatosin. I'm a memeber of the most recent cohort of the altschool africa programme. My coding journey began in 2023 when I had a front row view of the things one can acheive with the ability to code, i was immeadiately captivated and it has since then been my goal and dream to be the best I can at coding and I'm grateful for the opportunity altschool africa has given me. It is however my responsibility to use the chance given to me by this prestigious insitute of learning to try to impact the world positively.
